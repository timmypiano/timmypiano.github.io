Okay so to start I am going to use Rachel's website and use it as a template to start my website so that I have a place to start. 

Okay I am so lost this is hard I'm unsure how to like have a website show up on, wait nevermind haha. I just have to use the index file.
Okay so everything works but I'm trying to figure out how to add an image. 

Alright so I got the image yay, it works. Now I need to understand how HREF works, like do I need to create another HTML file or can it all just be coded into one? That kinda vibe. 

Okay so I'm not sure if this is the right method. But I just my index file and renamed it, and just copied that html file into the hyperlink and it works fire!! But maybe that's not the method I'm not sure but it worked. I know that for the hyperlink Rachel is using a website and I'm using a file so I'm unsure about how that'll translate on the web but let me go on step at a time and fill out all the code first. Oh wait nevermind it doesn't work :(. Okay so let me figure this out on github.

I'm using this reference: https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/html/introduction_to_html/creating_hyperlinks/index.md

OOOO so I wasn't on a bad route when I copied a new html file. It's starting to make sense.
