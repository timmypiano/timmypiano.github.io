Okay so to start I am going to use Rachel's website and use it as a template to start my website so that I have a place to start. 

Okay I am so lost this is hard I'm unsure how to like have a website show up on, wait nevermind haha. I just have to use the index file.
Okay so everything works but I'm trying to figure out how to add an image. 

Alright so I got the image yay, it works. Now I need to understand how HREF works, like do I need to create another HTML file or can it all just be coded into one? That kinda vibe. 

Okay so I'm not sure if this is the right method. But I just my index file and renamed it, and just copied that html file into the hyperlink and it works fire!! But maybe that's not the method I'm not sure but it worked. I know that for the hyperlink Rachel is using a website and I'm using a file so I'm unsure about how that'll translate on the web but let me go on step at a time and fill out all the code first. Oh wait nevermind it doesn't work :(. Okay so let me figure this out on github.

I'm using this reference: https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/html/introduction_to_html/creating_hyperlinks/index.md

OOOO so I wasn't on a bad route when I copied a new html file. It's starting to make sense. I just have to have all the html in the same folder, what an easy fix. 

Ayyye I feel so smart. Lol. Shoutout github for explaining so well. Youtube sucks. 

Alright so now my images and stuff are kinda huuuge and I know that's like a CSS thing, or I think it is? So let me research how CSS works. 

Going off this reference: https://gist.github.com/SylvioGiubine/9f1e04ed1f847e25dceb889173e02742# 

Okay so I gotta figure out if I wanna make it inline internal or external vibes. FIIRE, I see the vibes. 

https://imagekit.io/blog/how-to-resize-image-in-html/ This website is showing me how to resize images in github.

Alright I'm researching CSS stuff, trying to find templates and stuff, using this website: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp

Okay so I'm confused I can't find any templates that are just .css files, they seem to all be HTML. 

Alright so nevermind me being stupid about .css, I'm didn't realize it was an easy vibe.

I figured out how to make a picture more transparant vibes haha, let me see if there's any cool animation to add, or see if I can add music.

https://gist.github.com/AppLoidx/2f5fca393c72609b01d9550fe93d57f5 This website talks about adding audio on HTML.

Okay nevermind it didn't work and it's too complicated hahaha.

Okay so I'm like trying to understand how background images work with the CSS thing I copied but it's not really doing the job so I'm just gonna stick to this code because it looks pretty :) 

Okay I figured it out! I think lol. But my website looks kinda cool I can't lie, I'm like a coder now.

OOOO I forgot, this is the CSS template I used:
