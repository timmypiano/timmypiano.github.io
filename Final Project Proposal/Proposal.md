The title of my project will most likely be: TIMMYPIANO WEBSITE!

My project is about creating a website that I can use to share my music, skills, and have a portfolio/resume.

It will have 2 different pages you can click on, one is my music and one is my services. It will be executed using HTML. 

No matter what, I will have a website with my name on it and a picture of me!

The better outcome is that Iâ€™m able to share music files on it, without having to use an external link.

The best outcome is that I have music files that can be sold to be downloaded, and a contact me page where people can contact directly from the website. 

To acquire this skill, I will need to learn HTML and research different ways to create a website and make it look nice. 

I will use: Github, google, my friend Jeff who codes, and my cousin Jonathan who codes. 
Websites I am inspired by are:
https://sayagray.ca, I love the way there is a visual following the mouse. 

https://flying-lotus.com, I really like the way the website is organized. It's very neat and simple.
