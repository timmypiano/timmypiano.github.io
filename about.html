    I am a pianist, producer, mix engineer, and sound designer.
    <br>
    <br>
    I grew up in Paris, France where I went to the Paris Conservatory blah blah blah. I'll write a bio vibes blah blah.
    <br>
    Here is my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/timmypiano"> soundcloud lol </a>, where I have some archived works, it's no real projects, the real ones are on the way.
    <br>
    I value community, love, and music for the way it helps us escape collectively.
    <br>
    <br>
    I went to Berklee College of Music in the <a href="https://college.berklee.edu/electronic-production-design/">Electronic Porudction and Design department</a>, and hopefully will graduate.
    <br>
    I am fluent in French and English and love France I really don't like the US and Capitalism here is on some next level.
